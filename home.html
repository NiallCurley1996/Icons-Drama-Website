<h1>Welcome to Icons</h1><!--Intro message-->
<article> 
    <p>An acorn doesnt look like much in the palm of your hand, but plant it in the right soil and watch it grow to become a mighty oak tree. Here at Icons we teach your children to grow in their confidence and expression. We accomplish this through the medium of drama and singing. We encourage your child to be creative, to use their imagination and to have as much fun as possible.</p><!--Information  paragraphs-->
    
<h1>Come and Join The Fun!</h1>
<p>Your child will learn to be part of the story and will work with other children in teams, learning to communicate effectively with confidence and self belief. As children work togther in small units they also develop friendships that helps with their self esteem. Children who attend icons will gain accreditation over time through the various levels. Icons is dedicated to building confidence in young people between the ages of 6-14 years.</p>

<h1>Icons Story</h1>
<article>    
    <p>Icons Drama was created in 2007 by Mrs Toni McCann, Belfast. Toni has a masters degree from Queens University and is a passionate drama teacher. Icons first classes were hosted in St Michaels Parish Centre, Belfast.  Icons has since moved to St Agnes Parish Centre in 2011 where we now have our own stage, large hall, lighting and sound systems.</p>
    
    <p>Toni and the Icons team have been involved in a lot of drama and musical productions, some of which include; Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Shrek the Musical, The Nativity, The Sound of Music and so much more!</p>
